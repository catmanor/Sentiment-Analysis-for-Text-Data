# Sentiment-Analysis-Model-Development-for-Text-Data
The aim of this study is to build and evaluate the sentiment analysis models on the given dataset. The main goal is to create models that can accurately predict the sentiment of text data. The study includes:
1. Data Preprocessing
    - Data cleaning
    - Lemmatization
    - Normalization
2. Methodology
    - Convolution Neural Network (CNN)
    - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
    - K-Mean Clustering
3. Performance, Evaluation & Comparison
    - Precision
    - Recall
    - F1-score
Conclusion
The supervised models (CNN and LSTM) perform better than the unsupervised model (K-means) in the experiments.
